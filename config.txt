# Any lines that have a number sign (#) will be considered a comment and be ignored by the file saver.
# After these lines, there should be one empty line, and then all options will follow.
#
# Boolean values should have a 'true' or 'false'.
# Every option should start with the option, followed by an equals sign, followed by the value.
# There shouldn't be any spaces in the options.
#
# Options that aren't specified are set to the default
#
# Possible options:
#  ~ no-wait-between-segments (boolean)
#  ~ hide-previous-iteration (boolean)
#  ~ max-number-of-iterations (int, with the first iteration (straight line) being iteration 0)
#  ~ wait-between-iterations (long, in milliseconds)
#  ~ wait-between-segments (long, in milliseconds)
#  ~ only-exit-on-key (boolean, as defined by 'exit-key' (default is 'Esc'))
#  ~ exit-key (int, key values can be found at: 'http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.awt.event.KeyEvent.KEY_FIRST')
#  ~ current-iteration-segment-width (int, in pixels)
#  ~ previous-iteration-segment-width (int, in pixels)
#  ~ previous-iteration-transparency (float, 0.0 is transparent, 1.0 is solid)
#  ~ show-arguments (boolean)
#  ~ screensaver-end (float, if this number greater than 0, the screensaver will automatically end in that many seconds)
#  ~ screensaver-type (int, 0 for dragon fractal, 1 for scrolling code)
#  ~ output-file-location (String, directory for output files. Default is the code for this application)
