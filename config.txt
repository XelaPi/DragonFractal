# Only lines that start with one of the accepted options will be processed.
# Boolean values should have a 'true' or 'false'.
# Every option should start with the option, followed by an equals sign, followed by the value.
# There shouldn't be any spaces in the options.
# Options that are omitted are set to there default
# Possible options:
#   no-wait-between-segments (boolean)
#   hide-previous-iteration (boolean)
#   max-number-of-iterations (int, with the first iteration (straight line) being iteration 0)
#   wait-between-iterations (long, in milliseconds)
#   wait-between-segments (long, in milliseconds)
#   only-exit-on-key (boolean, as defined by 'exit-key' (default is 'Esc'))
#   exit-key (int, key values can be found at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/constant-values.html#java.awt.event.KeyEvent.KEY_FIRST)
#   current-iteration-segment-width (int, in pixels)
#   previous-iteration-segment-width (int, in pixels)
#   previous-iteration-transparency (float, 0.0 is transparent, 1.0 is solid)
